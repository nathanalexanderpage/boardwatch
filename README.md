# Boardwatch

## Concept

A bot to scour postings on secondhand market sites so I don't have to.

## Features

### Search

Platforms to be scoured, by method:
* Craigslist
* eBay
* LetGo
* OfferUp

### Notifications

Modes of findings notification:
* E-mail

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
